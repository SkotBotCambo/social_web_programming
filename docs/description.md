Have you been wanting to learn to program, but were unsure of where to start, who to ask, and what to ask them? You are not alone. 
Contributing to open-source projects has helped many people to become programmers and this
Computing Everywhere workshop will show you where to start.
Students of this class will be able to answer the following questions : 
* ***What is an open-source project? How does it work? How can I find them? How can I help?***
* ***How can I contribute to an open-source project when I'm just learning to code?*** Students will be surprised to learn that not only can 
amateur-produced code be helpful, but that there are other ways to contribute as well.
* ***How do I ask good questions (and get good answers)?*** Many who are just beginning to code are afraid to "say the wrong thing" when 
asking questions online. Students in this class will learn Stackoverflow's guidelines for asking questions so 
they can be sure to get the help they need.
