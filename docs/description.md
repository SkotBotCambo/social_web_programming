Today's internet is truly standing on the shoulders of giants and in a way, it always has been. The internet and the web
as we know it is the collective effort of its early citizens who asserted their vision for the web by programming it in much the 
same way that citizens of a democracy assert their vision by voting. Students of this 4-hour Computing Everywhere workshop will 
learn how to be contributing citzens of the social web in the following ways :
* Collectively contributing code toward a version controlled programming project. 
  This achieves the dual purpose of learning how to contribute code while simultaneously learning the art of programming.
* Learn to **ask** and **answer** questions on a QA platform, like StackOverflow or Quora, so that others with similar questions can learn from your inquiry
 and so that the best possible answer to the question can be elicited from the crowd.
 * Learn to make contributions other than code, like design feedback, bug reporting, or feature requests.
