Today's internet is truly standing on the shoulders of giants and in a way, it always has been. The internet and the web
as we know it is the collective effort of its early citizens who asserted their vision for the web by programming it in much the 
same way that citizens of a democracy assert their vision by voting.
With no experience needed, students of this 4-hour Computing Everywhere workshop will cooperatively learn to code and leave being able to 
answer the following questions : 
* *What is an open-source project? How does it work? How can I find them? How can I help?*
* *How can I contribute to an open-source project when I'm just learning to code?* Students will be surprised to learn that not only can 
amateur-produced code be helpful, but that there are other ways to contribute as well.
* *How do I ask good questions (and get good answers)?* Many who are just beginning to code are afraid to "say the wrong thing" when 
asking questions online. Students in this class will learn Stackoverflow's guidelines for asking questions so 
they can be sure to get the help they need.
