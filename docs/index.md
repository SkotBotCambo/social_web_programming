# Learn To Build The Social Web From The Social Web

# Participating in the Design and Development of the Web (Hour #1)
Since we have had the ability to connect two computers together over long distances, 
we have used it to collectively make this connection more interesting and more 
useful to more people. The open source movement sought to make this both a transparent 
process and one that we can freely participate in.  Today, the technologies that 
have been built by individuals acting collectively to design the future that we 
currently live in have often evolved with incredible complexity making them 
difficult to understand where new contributions can be made and where old ones 
might have been made in err. That said, there are also an unprecedented amount 
of resources to help newcomers to the social web of open source programming 
that are freely available online. In the first hour, students will learn about 
the 2 most popular technologies and resources used that enable these collective 
contributions to the web : Stackoverflow and Git (Github).

## Learning objectives for Hour #1
* Students will be introduced to the vision of open source as a way of democratizing the web.
* Students will learn how programmers act collectively using version control software, particularly Git and the web service Github.
  * Additionally students will learn how to make contributions that are not code, such as design feedback, reporting bugs, organizing   
  documentation, refining the communication of the purpose, etc. etc.
  * Students will also learn how Git/Github can be used for projects that are not software.
* Students will learn how to utilize the Question Answering website, Stackoverflow, as well as the many other [Stack Exchange websites](https://stackexchange.com/sites) built on the same technology.
  * students will learn the fundamentals of asking a question and answering a question
  * students will identify a question that they can provide an answer for somewhere in the stackexchange universe.

# Programming A Web Page With Javascript (Hour #2)
Javascript has become a clear leader as the programming language of the web. In fact, [in 2016 there were more contributions made to 
github repositories with javascript than by the next two programming languages (Java and Python) combined](https://octoverse.github.com/). 
In this hour, students will learn how to build a basic website and manipulate an existing one pulled from github repository.

## Learning Objectives for Hour #2
* Students will learn to pull website code from a github repository and open it in the browser
* Students will be introduced to a bare minimum amount of HTML needed for making javascript interesting.
  * HTML elements, element tags, element ids, element attributes
  * <head> and <body> tags
* Students will learn how to add javascript directly to an HTML file using the <script> tag
* Students will learn how to debug javascript and HTML as well as manipulate the DOM using the Chrome or Firefox browser console
* Students will learn the following Javascript programming concepts
  * assign variables
  * comment code
  * create functions
  * create methods
  * utilize conditionals
  * understand scope
  * understand javascript events
  * add event listeners
  * modify the DOM with javascript
  * modify browser rendering with css

# Sharing Your Work And Making A Contribution (Hour #3)
Arguably one of the most difficult aspects of joining the open source 
community is the final task, sharing. Students will learn how to commit 
changes they’ve made to code and push it to Github where it can be shared 
with the rest of the world. Students will also learn how to use the github 
website to offer design advice and create “issues” to document bugs or request features.
In particular, students will use the github repo hosting this exact page to give feedback on 
the workshop material and contribute other resources they may find helpful while learning to program.

## Learning Objectives for Hour #3
* Students will push the modifications they've made to their code to their own github repositories
* Students will create issues to provide feedback for this workshop github repository
* Students will learn how to document their work and comment their commits/changes so that others can easily understand what contribution was made and why

# Mob Programming and Challenge-Based Learning (Hour #4)
One of the often overlooked skills of contributing to open source software is the labor of determining a good 
project and organizing people to contribute to it.  During the final hour (remaining time) students will
brainstorm and negotiate a short list of ideas for information or technology resources that might be helpful 
to other students of the Computing Everywhere series. These ideas will be used as the basis for a challenge-based learning
project where the instructor will guide them to develop a plan for collectively and digitally manifesting the idea.
Students will also learn a social technique for coding and learning to code called Mob Programming where many programmers
organize around a single computer on a single task at a time. Mob Programming helps to maintain synchronized knowledge of a project's
needs and progress through shared experience.

## Learning Objectives for Hour #4
* Students will learn how to use Challenge Based Learning to build technical skills while also making contributions toward a higher level goal
* Students will learn a technique (often used at hackathons) for organizing programmers to design and build something quickly that is often used at hackathons
shared context and contributions
