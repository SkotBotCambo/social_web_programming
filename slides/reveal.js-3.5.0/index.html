					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* I'm here teaching this workshop today for two reasons
							1. Software is a bigger part of lives than ever and more people want to learn to program than ever.
								* This is great. At the least, you should want to learn something that has a big impact on your life and at the worst you should try something 
								that a great many people have derived a lot of joy from doing.
							2. One of the best ways to learn to program is in a social setting.
								* What I mean is that there is a way in which we often discuss 
								programming in the context of computer science or computational 
								thinking. 
								* That makes sense, in a university one often begins learning  to 
								program in a computer science class and programming is used as a way
								to put those concepts in to practice.
								* In this class, we'll try a different approach which will be mainly
								  grounded in the ideas of **open-source** and **peer production**.

					<h3>What is open source?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Open Exchange</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Participation</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Rapid Prototyping</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Meritocracy</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Community</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="color:blue;font-size:0.7em;">Democracy (<i>Code and Other Laws</i> by Lawrence Lessig)</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="font-size:0.6em;">Credit to opensource.com</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Open Exchange : Information is freely available. We can freely exchange designs, instructions, code
						* Participation : We are free to collaborate and discuss solutions together.
						* Rapid Prototyping : fast prototypes lead to quicker failures and there is
						   the idea that the quicker we fail, we quicker we can discover how to succeed.
						* Meritocracy : The best idea wins. Seems obvious, but often a less than optimal idea can simply corner a market preventing better ideas from succeeding.
						* Community : Communities will often form around a common purpose bringing together diverse ideas.
						* Democracy : I'll also add this as it is a point that people like Lawrence Lessig have started to make which is that with so much of our society being 
						computationally driven that programmers are not just people who can make 
						software, they are people who get to decide the structure of modern society. 
						Google decides how we find information, Amazon decides how we find things to buy, Facebook decides how we learn what our friends are doing. Software
						is a powerful institution and for those institutions to be democratic, we'll
						need a way to participate.  Open source is a way that we can participate
						in those institutions.

						## Note : Mike Devito and I often teach a Computing Everywhere workshop
						where we discuss algorithmically driven components of culture
						and society in a bit more detail.  Keep an eye out for that
						if you find this interesting.

						* I chose the name *Social Web Programming* because 
							 * we will be focusing on web technologies, specifically javascript
							 * To do this, we'll leverage a social web meaning that we'll learn
							 how to use both the people here in this class and the people on the
							 web to answer questions that come up.
						* Github : We'll learn to use github, so that we can find open source
						projects, read their code, and participate in the projects
						* Workshop Github : This is the first time I'm teaching this workshop and while
						I am the instructor, you are the community that will benefit from it. Throughout
						the class, I'm going to be asking you to give lots of feedback to me and your classmates.

					<p class="fragment">Let's take a look : <a href="https://github.com/scottofthescience/social_web_programming">https://github.com/scottofthescience/social_web_programming</a></li></p>


					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Git : how many of you have used "Track changes" in MS Word?
							* This is sort of like that, but the idea is that we can scale to many more people and use this for code
						* Github : This is the hub. This is where the code goes when we want other people to see it so that they can comment on it or integrate it or work on it.

						# You won't learn everything about Git and GitHub today for a couple reasons. The first is that there are
						a lot of ways that you can use Git and Github.  It's a very flexible system. So exactly how you should use it depends on the needs of the community and the project.
						* On the front page :
							* README.md
							* /docs : files for a webpage for our project
							* /slides : That's where these files are
							* LICENSE tells people how they can or cannot use this content.
							* Issues
							* There is much more that we won't have time to discuss today so I encourage you to look at some of the resources

					<img data-src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GuamYo4eL.jpg" height="25%" width="25%">

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Now, there are a lot of ways in which crowds are not wise, but I want to bring up two reasons here
						that we can leverage ideas collectively learn more about programming even if nobody in the room
						feel comfortable calling themseles an expert.
						1. **There is a lot of knowledge in this room** We each may have heard and understood a different part of an answer and by asking questions
						and communicating with each other, we can put all those pieces together to form an answer.
						2. **There is a lot of diversity in this room** meaning that if we each have a tendency to make different kinds of mistakes, then we can aggregate our weak answers to approximate a really good answer.

								* IceWeasel was started because there are some parts of Firefox that
								are proprietary and closed. If you are worried about security, this is not helpful, because you can never be entirely sure that what happens in the closed code is safe.

						* Reporting bugs is similar to how we talked about asking questions except now 
						the problem is with someone else's work. Figure out when it does work and when 
						it doesn't work. Test your understanding of what's going on.  All of this helps 
						you become a better programmer
						* Sometimes a project gets started by someone who is more interested in parts 
						of the technology which don't face the user.  If that is something you are 
						interested in and you like the project, you can make design suggestions
						and offer up design work yourself.
						* These are all things that help create a great portfolio regardless of whether 
						or not you think you'll be a programmer. 
						Open source let's you show your contributions in a way that help you 
						signal to people you might want to work with that you know how to communicate,
						you know how to work with people, you know how to organize, and maybe you
						even know a little about how to code too.
