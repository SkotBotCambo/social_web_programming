					<h2>Welcome To Social Web Programming</h1>

					<h3>Why Teach This Workshop?</h3>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Software is a bigger part of our lives than ever and more people want to learn to program than ever.</li>
						<li class="fragment">One of the best ways to learn to program is in a social setting.</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* I'm here teaching this workshop today for two reasons
							1. Software is a bigger part of lives than ever and more people want to learn to program than ever.
								* This is great. At the least, you should want to learn something that has a big impact on your life and at the worst you should try something 
								that a great many people have derived a lot of joy from doing.
							2. One of the best ways to learn to program is in a social setting.
								* What I mean is that there is a way in which we often discuss 
								programming in the context of computer science or computational 
								thinking. 
								* That makes sense, in a university one often begins learning  to 
								program in a computer science class and programming is used as a way
								to put those concepts in to practice.
								* In this class, we'll try a different approach which will be mainly
								  grounded in the ideas of **open-source** and **peer production**.

					<h3>What is open source?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Open Exchange</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Participation</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Rapid Prototyping</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Meritocracy</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="font-size:0.7em;">Community</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="color:blue;font-size:0.7em;">Democracy (<italic>Code and Other Laws</italic> by Lawrence Lessig)</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="font-size:0.6em;">Credit to opensource.com</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Open Exchange : Information is freely available. We can freely exchange designs, instructions, code
						* Participation : We are free to collaborate and discuss solutions together.
						* Rapid Prototyping : fast prototypes lead to quicker failures and there is
						   the idea that the quicker we fail, we quicker we can discover how to succeed.
						* Meritocracy : The best idea wins. Seems obvious, but often a less than optimal idea can simply corner a market preventing better ideas from succeeding.
						* Community : Communities will often form around a common purpose bringing together diverse ideas.
						* Democracy : I'll also add this as it is a point that people like Lawrence Lessig have started to make which is that with so much of our society being 
						computationally driven that programmers are not just people who can make 
						software, they are people who get to decide the structure of modern society. 
						Google decides how we find information, Amazon decides how we find things to buy, Facebook decides how we learn what our friends are doing. Software
						is a powerful institution and for those institutions to be democratic, we'll
						need a way to participate.  Open source is a way that we can participate
						in those institutions.

						## Note : Mike Devito and I often teach a Computing Everywhere workshop
						where we discuss algorithmically driven components of culture
						and society in a bit more detail.  Keep an eye out for that
						if you find this interesting.

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* I chose the name *Social Web Programming* because 
							 * we will be focusing on web technologies, specifically javascript
							 * To do this, we'll leverage a social web meaning that we'll learn
							 how to use both the people here in this class and the people on the
							 web to answer questions that come up.
						* Github : We'll learn to use github, so that we can find open source
						projects, read their code, and participate in the projects
						* Workshop Github : This is the first time I'm teaching this workshop and while
						I am the instructor, you are the community that will benefit from it. Throughout
						the class, I'm going to be asking you to give lots of feedback to me and your classmates.

					<h3>GitHub</h3>
					<p>What even is that?</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Git</b> : version control software</li>
						<li><b>GitHub</b> : A Hub for projects that use <b>Git</b></li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						* Git : how many of you have used "Track changes" in MS Word?
							* This is sort of like that, but the idea is that we can scale to many more people and use this for code
